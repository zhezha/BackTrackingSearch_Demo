# BackTrackingSearch_Demo

Backtracking search with recursion

A secret phrase consists of words from a given *wordlist* file. Given<br>
1. An anagram of the phase: "no city dust here"<br>
2. The MD5 hash of the secret phrase: "b411f74102bfc6155ad322251a49e7a6"

The demo code searches for the secret phrase in the file *wordlist*.

If you try to run the code to see what the secret phase is, it might take some time :-)
